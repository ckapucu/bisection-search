# Bisection Search

In this study, we used the bisection search algorithm to find the exact pair of series and parallel resistances that guarantees that the derivative of the power with respect to the voltage equals zero at the MPP. The study is coded in Matlab script. You can find a relevant research article I used bisection search algorithm for extracting the reference parameters of PV modules.

#### Abstract

Manufacturers generally share datasheet values of photovoltaic (PV) modules at only standard test conditions (STC). These conditions enable PV modules to generate high power but are rarely encountered in the real environment. Therefore, accurate modeling of PV modules is very important in terms of estimating the energy that can be obtained under all operating conditions. Many studies have been conducted in this field in the literature. In this study, a new method is proposed for the implementation of the commonly used five-parameter model. This new method uses a bisection search algorithm for calculating the value of the series resistance, which is one of the five parameters, and thus extracting the other parameters. The datasheet values provided by the manufacturers are sufficient for obtaining the series resistance and therefore other parameters. The accuracy of the method was first tested by comparing the datasheet values of the three different PV modules with the outputs of the proposed method. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the proposed method for different operating conditions was tested by comparing the real measurement data collected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the outputs of the method under the same operating conditions. The results show that the proposed method demonstrates good agreement with both datasheet values and real measurement data. The method offers a good balance of simplicity-accuracy.
